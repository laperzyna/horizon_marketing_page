# Module 1 Challenge: horizon_marketing_page

This URL is linked to the horizon marketing page where users are informed about search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing. I took the starter code and added semantic HTML elements, fixed the structure of html elements, added alt attributes for disabled users, fixed the heading attributes, and gave the title a concise, descriptive title.

# what I struggled with:

I definitely struggled with matching the list in the header with the mock up. I followed the instructions shown in class but I'm not sure why the headers don't go back to the way they were originally. The other thing I struggled with was just understanding the user story/criteria. Normally, I am given instructions that exactly tell me what I need to implement with output examples so it was super interesting and challenging to understand what to do exactly when given the acceptance criteria.
